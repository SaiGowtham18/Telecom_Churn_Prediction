# 📊 Customer Churn Prediction

## 📝 Project Overview
This project aims to predict customer churn using machine learning models. By analyzing customer behavior and identifying key churn indicators, businesses can proactively retain customers and improve revenue. The model is optimized for high accuracy and deployed for real-time prediction.

## 🎯 Goals
- Identify factors contributing to customer churn.
- Build a robust predictive model for churn classification.
- Handle class imbalance and improve model performance.
- Deploy the model for real-time usage.

## 🔬 Approach & Models Used
1. **Data Exploration & Preprocessing**
   - Feature engineering & missing value handling.
   - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand churn patterns.
   
2. **Model Selection & Training**
   - Baseline models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest.
   - Optimized model: **XGBoost** with hyperparameter tuning.
   - **SMOTEEN for class balancing** to improve minority class prediction.
   
3. **Evaluation & Optimization**
   - AUC-ROC and accuracy used as primary metrics.

## 🚀 Technologies Used
- **Languages & Frameworks:** Python, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Pandas, NumPy.
- **Data Processing:** SMOTEEN, Feature Engineering, EDA.
